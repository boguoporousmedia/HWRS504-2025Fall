<h3>1. Class Recordings</h3>

> All of the lectures will be recorded and the links to the recordings will be posted on D2L. Students must access recorded content in D2L only. Students may not modify content or re-use content for any purpose other than personal educational reasons. All recordings are subject to government and university regulations. Therefore, students accessing unauthorized recordings or using them in a manner inconsistent with UArizona values and educational policies are subject to suspension or civil action.
