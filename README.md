<h3>4. Course Description:</h3> 

> The course focuses on the physical concepts underlying water flow and solute transport in variably saturated media. We will approach these concepts from a fundamental perspective of multiphase flow and transport in porous media to help students build a strong physical intuition. This will be complemented by a discussion of measurement methods and analysis of the relevant processes. New cutting-edge topics on the fate and transport of emerging contaminants (e.g., PFAS) in the vadose zone will also be introduced.

<h3>5. Prerequisites and Equipment/Software Requirements:</h3> 

> - HWRS 518 or with permission of Dr. Bo Guo.
> - You will need access to a computer to run [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [MS Excel spreadsheets](https://www.remote-learning.arizona.edu/install-office-365-your-computer), the software [HYDRUS-1D](https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?Downloads).


<h3>6. Assignments and Exams:</h3>

> **Homework Problem Sets**
> 
> Five problem sets will be assigned throughout the semester, due in one or two weeks after release. When submitting on D2L, convert your file to PDF and name it as *Last_name_HW1*. For example, *Guo_HW1.pdf*. Whether you type or handwrite, the text and figures need to be readable to an average human being. Nonreadable homework will be returned without grading. See [Schedule](https://guoporousmedialab.github.io/HWRS505-405-2023Fall/schedule/) for the specific dates.
> 
> **Exams**
> 
> The class has mid-term and final exams. The mid-term is oral and the final is written. The final will be scheduled during the exam week. A review session will be scheduled before both exams.
> 
> **Final Project:** *Only required for students who take the graduate version of the class HWRS 505.*
> 
> Students will have two options for the final project: 
> - (1) Choose a research topic of interest related to processes in the vadose zone, read 3 to 5 relevant papers, and provide a critical review of their research questions, methodologies, results, and implications.
> - (2) Choose a research problem in your own field of interest and apply the concepts and research tools covered in class to systematically tackle the problem.
> 
> For either option, you will need to summarize your key findings in a formal report and deliver a presentation in class.
> 
> **Art of Porous Media Flow**
> 
> As we will see in this class, the movement of fluids especially those in porous structures is full of beauty and you see it almost every day. During the semester, I encourage all of you to pay attention to any porous media flow phenomena in your day-to-day life. At the end of the semester, I would like all of you to submit a piece of artwork illustrating at least one interesting aspect of porous media flow. It can be a photo or short video you take or other forms of artwork of your choice. Whatever you decide to submit, make sure that it is entertaining!
